"# Get_stock_data" 

After tring out lot of diffreernt APIs and services for getting the accurate real time stock data I found these very useful and effective ways to gather the real time stock data.

So that you can save significant aount of time in trying to figure out how to get real time stock data and focus on you main trading algorithm.

I will be very happy if this algorithm can halp you in any way.

# How to use

* Download the repo and install all the above given requirements (for your convinience I have created a requirement.txt file in the repo, so you can directly install all the requiremnts from that .txt file)
* Update the config.py file by putting all the required information (for this you may need to have alpaca trading account which you can creat by going to https://app.alpaca.markets/login.
* Finally, Run get_data_from_socked.py file and yiu are all set. You can understand the code by reviewing comments written in the file.

I would really appriciate any suggestion you might have so that I can inprove this process or if you have any other reliable methodd of getting live stock data please feel free to share with me here or you can mail me at vedantdesai07@gmail.com. Thank you
